              ** Project based tutoring is effectively an "unlimitted tutoring
              plan". We have sessions as often as possible with time for
              homework in between. The total amount is due upfront. You may also
              pay in 3 installments with an additional 5% convenience fee: 20
              percent upfront, 40% after the first 20 tutoring hours, and the
              rest after the next 20 tutoring hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you start with hourly sessions, book less than 30 hours, and
              later switch to Project Based tutoring, you will recieve a
              pro-rated price.
