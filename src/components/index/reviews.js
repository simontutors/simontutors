        review="After working with Simon for 2 months, my son increased his SHSAT score by 150 points… enough to get him into his first choice school. Simon is the best SHSAT tutor ever (I’ve had many other tutors previously). When my son first started working with Simon, he could not finish the practice test, despite working with another private tutor and being enrolled in Kaplan. He exceeded all expectations and built my son’s confidence in himself. Simon is extremely knowledgeable, strategic, and focused on getting the highest score possible, and he will get your child there. My son says that Simon is THE reason he will go to his first choice school."
